# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. The project serves as the back-end component to the WTWR React project.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12

**Project Features**

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Postman
- ESLint
- Prettier
- REST API

## Project Goals

The ultimate goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

**Next Steps**
In order to make this project even better, I will provide the server access to authentification data and dynamically assign user IDs to clothing items that are produced, allowing each user to have a unique set of clothes.
